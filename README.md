**Develop a console-based application to implement Snakes and Ladders Game**

The Snakes and Ladders game is played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered, gridded squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped or hindered by ladders and snakes respectively.

**Requirements:**
- Game must be developed in console mode i.e no GUI is to be developed.
- Use OOP principles to implement Game Board, Squares, Snakes and Ladders). Design the classes with appropriate variables and methods.
- Grid size must not be negative.
- Number of players is at least two.
- Check for conflicting points while randomly placing the snakes and ladders.
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- Read the grid size and number of players from console.
- Automatically roll the dice for each player on their turn.

- When game is over, list the payers with their status.
